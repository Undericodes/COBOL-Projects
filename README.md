# COBOL Learning Journey

I've created this repo to document my learning progress as I dive into one of the most widely used programming languages, COBOL.

## Why COBOL?

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) has been a cornerstone of business and government operations for decades. Despite being considered a "legacy" language, COBOL continues to power critical systems around the world, particularly in finance, insurance, and government sectors. Learning COBOL not only helps in understanding the foundations of modern computing but also opens up opportunities to work with these essential systems.

## What This Repository Will Include

- **Code Samples**: As I learn, I'll be adding various COBOL programs that demonstrate different features of the language.
- **Exercises and Projects**: I'll document and share solutions to exercises and small projects, which will help solidify my understanding of COBOL.
- **Resources**: I'll also curate a list of resources, such as tutorials, articles, and books that I find helpful in my learning journey.

## Goals

1. **Understand COBOL Syntax and Structure**: Gain a solid grasp of COBOL's unique syntax and structure.
2. **Work with Legacy Systems**: Learn how COBOL interacts with mainframes and legacy systems, including databases and batch processing.
3. **Contribute to Open Source**: Eventually, I hope to contribute to COBOL-based open-source projects or even create my own.

## Next Steps

- Start with basic COBOL programs to understand the fundamentals.
- Explore more complex topics like file handling, database interaction, and batch processing.
- Work on real-world scenarios that COBOL programmers often encounter.

## Feedback and Collaboration

If you're also learning COBOL or have experience with it, feel free to reach out! I'm open to feedback, collaboration, and discussions on all things COBOL.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to explore the world of COBOL!
